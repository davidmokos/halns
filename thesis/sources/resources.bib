They may provide a time window on their desired departure or arrival time. Transportation is supplied by a fleet of vehicles based at a common depot. The aim is to design a set of least cost vehicle routes capable of accommodating all requests. Side constraints relate to vehicle capacity, route duration and the maximum ride time of any user. Extensive computational results are reported on randomly generated and real-life data sets.}

GES is a recently proposed metaheuristc framework and was first applied to the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The existence of the pickup and delivery constraint makes the feasible solution space tightly constrained and then makes the design of effective metaheuristics more difficult. We demonstrate that GES can be successfully applied to such an complicated problem. Experimental results on the Li and Lim's benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GES algorithm outperforms existing algorithms and is able to improve 105 best-known solutions out of 298 instances.",

This chapter discusses some of the most important vehicle routing problem types. The vehicle routing problem lies at the heart of distribution management. It is faced each day by thousands of companies and organizations engaged in the delivery and collection of goods or people. Because conditions vary from one setting to the next, the objectives and constraints encountered in practice are highly variable. Most algorithmic research and software development in this area focus on a limited number of prototype problems. By building enough flexibility in optimization systems, these can be adapted to various practical contexts. The classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) is one of the most popular problems in combinatorial optimization, and its study has given rise to several exact and heuristic solution techniques of general applicability. The chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the available exact and heuristic algorithms for the VRP, most of which have been adapted to solve other variants.}

    abstract = { We consider online routing optimization problems where the objective is to minimize the time needed to visit a set of locations under various constraints; the problems are online because the set of locations are revealed incrementally over time. We consider two main problems: (1) the online traveling salesman problem (TSP) with precedence and capacity constraints, and (2) the online TSP with m salesmen. For both problems we propose online algorithms, each with a competitive ratio of 2; for the m-salesmen problem, we show that our result is best-possible. We also consider polynomial-time online algorithms. We then consider resource augmentation, where we give the online servers additional resources to offset the powerful offline adversary advantage. In this way, we address a main criticism of competitive analysis. We consider the cases where the online algorithm has access to faster servers, servers with larger capacities, additional servers, and/or advanced information. We derive improved competitive ratios. We also give lower bounds on the competitive ratios under resource augmentation, which in many cases are tight and lead to best-possible results. Finally, we study online algorithms from an asymptotic point of view. We show that, under general stochastic structures for the problem data, unknown and unused by the online player, the online algorithms are almost surely asymptotically optimal. Furthermore, we provide computational results that show that the convergence can be very fast. }

  abstract={This paper examines approximate dynamic programming algorithms for the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands from a dynamic or reoptimization perspective. The methods extend the rollout algorithm by implementing different base sequences (i.e. a priori solutions), look-ahead policies, and pruning schemes. The paper also considers computing the cost-to-go with Monte Carlo simulation in addition to direct approaches. The best new method found is a two-step lookahead rollout started with a stochastic base sequence. The routing cost is about 4.8\% less than the one-step rollout algorithm started with a deterministic sequence. Results also show that Monte Carlo cost-to-go estimation reduces computation time 65\% in large instances with little or no loss in solution quality. Moreover, the paper compares results to the perfect information case from solving exact a posteriori solutions for sampled vehicle routing problems. The confidence interval for the overall mean difference is (3.56\%, 4.11\%).},

We address the important case of responsiveness. Responsiveness is defined here as completing a delivery as soon as possible, within the time window, such that the client or the vehicle may restart its activities. We develop an interactive solution to allow dispatchers to take new information into account in real-time. The algorithm and its parametrization were tested on real and artificial instances. We first illustrate our approach with a problem submitted by Liege Airport, the 8th biggest cargo airport in Europe. The goal is to develop a decision system to optimize the journey of the refueling trucks. We then consider some classical VRP benchmarks with extensions to the responsiveness context.}

abstract={{\enspace}We consider the Vehicle Routing Problem, in which a fixed fleet of delivery vehicles of uniform capacity must service known customer demands for a single commodity from a common depot at minimum transit cost. This difficult combinatorial problem contains both the Bin Packing Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as special cases and conceptually lies at the intersection of these two well-studied problems. The capacity constraints of the integer programming formulation of this routing model provide the link between the underlying routing and packing structures. We describe a decomposition-based separation methodology for the capacity constraints that takes advantage of our ability to solve small instances of the TSP efficiently. Specifically, when standard procedures fail to separate a candidate point, we attempt to decompose it into a convex combination of TSP tours; if successful, the tours present in this decomposition are examined for violated capacity constraints; if not, the Farkas Theorem provides a hyperplane separating the point from the TSP polytope. We present some extensions of this basic concept and a general framework within which it can be applied to other combinatorial models. Computational results are given for an implementation within the parallel branch, cut, and price framework SYMPHONY.},

abstract = {One of the most important objectives in company logistics is the optimization of goods distribution considering the whole value chain. There are many algorithms to optimise the capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRP) associated to problems of road transportation. The objective function of those problems usually involves distance, cost, number of vehicles, or profits, among others. In this contribution we also take into account environmental costs. Here, we want to manage environmental costs estimations based on surveys about road transportation crossing rural areas having valuable biological and natural stock. Thus, we develop some variants (AWEC) to traditional heuristic algorithms, such as those of Clarke and Wright or Mole and Jameson, in which we include environmental cost estimates in real scenarios in Spain. This raises the value of the global objective function, but permits a more realistic cost estimate that includes not only the internal costs involved in the problem but also the related externalities. Finally, we discuss several solutions to a real case in the agribusiness sector in Navarre (Spain).}

abstract = {This paper introduces the heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with time windows and a limited number of resources (HVRPTW-LR), a practical extension of the classical vehicle routing problem in which routes to be designed share common scarce resources. The HVRPTW-LR arises when a limited number of resources, such as vehicles, drivers, instruments, and so on, are available but are insufficient to serve all customers in a route planning. Therefore, the route design involves the selection of customers to be visited at each route and resources to be used. Applications to this problem are found in real services companies with high seasonal demand which attend to different types of works and have to decide on how to effectively manage their resources. For designing optimal routes, a hierarchical objective function is considered, maximizing the total number of served customers as the primary objective, and minimizing the travel costs as secondary. A mathematical model of linear programming is introduced to describe and understand all constraints clearly. The problem is first heuristically solved by a semi-parallel insertion heuristic. Then, solutions are improved by a hybrid variable neighborhood descent metaheuristic based on a Tabu Search algorithm for the exploration of the neighborhood and a holding list. Experiments are conducted on numerous sets of benchmark instances from the literature to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has a good performance and can be easily applied for solving numerous vehicle routing problem variants from the literature. A new set of benchmark cases for the HVRPTW-LR are also presented and solved.}

Although often encountered in practice, the problem, which we call heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing with overloads and time windows (HFVROTW), has not been previously tackled in the literature. We model it by integrating the constraint of the total trip load into the objective function, and solve it via a sequential insertion heuristic that employs a penalty function allowing capacity violations but limiting them to a variable predefined upper bound. Computational results on benchmark problems show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing vehicle costs with minimal capacity violations, thus offering evidence of the significance of this VRP variant.}

This resulted in an increase in the courier service business for shipping goods to customers. The types of goods processed through courier services are very diverse and shipments that are processed by courier services continue to increase. In previous studies only discussed the delivery using homogeneous vehicles, without grouping and the number of shipments is limited. This study aims to minimize the route and the number of heterogeneous vehicles serving more than 1,500 shipments per day by courier service. Therefore, in this study is based on the VRP concept of heterogeneous vehicles to minimize route and courier service vehicles. The use of the K-Means cluster method in this study aims to classify customers, minimize delivery distance and shorten the computation time. Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is applied by using the criteria of many generations to be achieved and the difference in efficiency rates between generations to get the results of route optimization and courier service vehicles.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Transportation on Demand (TOD) is concerned with the transportation of passengers or goods between specific origins and destinations at the request of users. In recent years, TOD systems have become increasingly popular for a number of reasons. With the aging of the population and the trend toward the development of ambulatory health care services, more and more people rely on door-to-door transportation systems provided by local authorities. Aircraft sharing has also gained in popularity because of the cost reduction efforts made by organizations and the numerous problems that have recently plagued the airline industry. A growing emphasis on electronic commerce, cycle-time compression, and just-in-time deliveries has increased the need for demand-responsive freight transportation systems. TOD systems can be either static or dynamic. In the first case, all requests are known beforehand, while in the second case, requests are received dynamically and vehicle routes must be adjusted in real-time to meet demand. Most TOD problems are characterized by the presence of three often conflicting objectives: maximizing the number of requests served, minimizing operating costs, and minimizing user inconvenience.}

ABSTRACT = {The transportation of elderly and impaired people is commonly solved as a Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP). The DARP aims to design pick-up and delivery vehicle routing schedules. Its main objective is to accommodate as many users as possible with a minimum operation cost. It adds realistic precedence and transit time constraints on the pairing of vehicles and customers. This paper tackles the DARP with time windows (DARPTW) from a new and innovative angle as it combines hybridization techniques with an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic algorithm. The main objective is to improve the overall real-life performance of vehicle routing operations. Real-life data are refined and fed to a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (Hybrid-ALNS) algorithm which provides a near-optimal routing solution. The computational results on real-life instances, in the Canadian city of Vancouver and its region, and DARPTW benchmark instances show the potential improvements achieved by the proposed heuristic and its adaptability.},

In this paper, we present the development of a new optimization algorithm for its solution. The LP relaxation of the set partitioning formulation of the VRPTW is solved by column generation. Feasible columns are added as needed by solving a shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraints using dynamic programming. The LP solution obtained generally provides an excellent lower bound that is used in a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the integer set partitioning formulation. Our results indicate that this algorithm proved to be successful on a variety of practical sized benchmark VRPTW test problems. The algorithm was capable of optimally solving 100-customer problems.

In this enhanced optimization algorithm, the coupling constraints require that each customer be serviced. The subproblem is a shortest path problem with time window and capacity constraints. We apply branch and bound to obtain integer solutions. We first branch on the number of vehicles if this is fractional, and then on the flow variables. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on problems of up to 100 customers from the Solomon datasets. It has succeeded in solving to optimality several previously unsolved problems and a new 150-customer problem. In addition, the algorithm proved faster than algorithms previously considered in the literature. These computational results indicate the effectiveness of the valid inequalities we have developed.},

The time constraints consist of upper bounds on: (1) the amount of time by which the pick-up or delivery of a customer can deviate from the desired pick-up or delivery time; (2) the time that a customer can spend riding in a vehicle. The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers' preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested, and for short ride times. Computational experience with the algorithm is described, including a run with a real database of 2600 customers and some 20 simultaneously active vehicles. The scenario for the application of the algorithm is also discussed in detail.}

Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time.}

abstract = {This paper reports on a system developed to address the dial-a-ride problem and an implementation for Maryland where real-world practical constraints are considered in providing customized vehicle routing and scheduling for about 450 trip requests daily. The system, called Mobile Resource Management System (MRMS), allows for dispatch operators to quickly study different operational scenarios and, in a strategic setting, explore tradeoffs between level-of-service and various system characteristics, including fleet composition, fleet size and dispatch rules. Such insights play a key role in making long-term investment decisions or estimating cost of servicing contracts that have service level agreements. Test comparison of manual and MRMS-based routes indicated an estimated annual operational expense reduction of \$0.82 million, or about 18\% of the total annual expense. In addition to the cost benefits, improved quality of service and the reduction in total vehicle-kilometers traveled leading to environmental benefits are demonstrated.}

abstract = {This article focuses on the mechanism of evaluating solution neighborhoods, an algorithmic aspect which plays a crucial role on the efficiency of local-search based approaches. In specific, it presents a strategy for reducing the computational complexity required for applying local search to tackle various combinatorial optimization problems. The value of this contribution is two-fold. It helps practitioners design efficient local search implementations, and it facilitates the application of robust commercial local search-based algorithms to practical instances of very large size. The central rationale underlying the proposed complexity reduction strategy is straightforward: when a local search operator is applied to a given solution, only a limited part of this solution is modified. Thus, to exhaustively examine the neighborhood of the new solution, only the tentative moves that refer to the modified solution part have to be evaluated. To reduce the complexity of neighborhood evaluation, the static move descriptor (SMD) data structures are introduced, which encode local search moves in a systematic and solution independent manner. The proposed strategy is applied to the vehicle routing problem (VRP) which is of high importance both from the practical and theoretical viewpoints. The use of the SMD concept, for encoding three commonly applied quadratic local search operators, results into a VRP local search method which exhibits an almost linearithmic complexity in respect to the instance size. Furthermore, exploiting the SMD representation of tentative moves, a metaheuristic strategy is proposed, which is aimed at diversifying the conducted search via a simple penalization policy. The proposed metaheuristic was tested on various large and very large scale VRP benchmark instances. It produced fine results, and managed to improve several best known solutions. The method was also executed on real-world instances of 3000 customers, the data of which reflects the actual geographic distribution of customers within four major cities.},

The total length of any route must not exceed a pre-specified bound. Approximate methods based on descent, hybrid simulated annealing/tabu search, and tabu search algorithms are developed and different search strategies are investigated. A special data structure for the tabu search algorithm is implemented which has reduced notably the computational time by more than 50{\%}. An estimate for the tabu list size is statistically derived. Computational results are reported on a sample of seventeen bench-mark test problems from the literature and nine randomly generated problems.

This problem has been solved in the literature with several approaches from small to medium sized problems. However, few efforts have dealt with large scale problems very common in massive scenarios (big cities or highly-populated regions). In this study, a new distributed algorithm based on the partition of the requests space and the combination of the routes is presented and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale problem (up to 16,000 requests or 32,000 locations) in the city of San Francisco. The results show that, not only the distributed algorithm is able to solve large problem instances that the corresponding sequential algorithm is unable to solve in a reasonable time, but also to have an average improvement of 9\% in the smaller problems. The results have been validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the distributed algorithm can be an effective way to solve high dimensional dial-a-ride problems.}

abstract = {The problem of transporting patients or elderly people has been widely studied in literature and is usually modeled as a dial-a-ride problem (DARP). In this paper we analyze the corresponding problem arising in the daily operation of the Austrian Red Cross. This nongovernmental organization is the largest organization performing patient transportation in Austria. The aim is to design vehicle routes to serve partially dynamic transportation requests using a fixed vehicle fleet. Each request requires transportation from a patient's home location to a hospital (outbound request) or back home from the hospital (inbound request). Some of these requests are known in advance. Some requests are dynamic in the sense that they appear during the day without any prior information. Finally, some inbound requests are stochastic. More precisely, with a certain probability each outbound request causes a corresponding inbound request on the same day. Some stochastic information about these return transports is available from historical data. The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether using this information in designing the routes has a significant positive effect on the solution quality. The problem is modeled as a dynamic stochastic dial-a-ride problem with expected return transports. We propose four different modifications of metaheuristic solution approaches for this problem. In detail, we test dynamic versions of variable neighborhood search (VNS) and stochastic VNS (S-VNS) as well as modified versions of the multiple plan approach (MPA) and the multiple scenario approach (MSA). Tests are performed using 12 sets of test instances based on a real road network. Various demand scenarios are generated based on the available real data. Results show that using the stochastic information on return transports leads to average improvements of around 15\%. Moreover, improvements of up to 41\% can be achieved for some test instances.}

If not accounted for, time-dependent and stochastic travel speeds frequently lead to missed time windows and thus poorer service. Especially in the case of passenger transportation, it often leads to excessive passenger ride times as well. Therefore, time-dependent and stochastic influences on travel speeds are relevant for finding feasible and reliable solutions. This study considers the effect of exploiting statistical information available about historical accidents, using stochastic solution approaches for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (dynamic DARP). The authors propose two pairs of metaheuristic solution approaches, each consisting of a deterministic method (average time-dependent travel speeds for planning) and its corresponding stochastic version (exploiting stochastic information while planning). The results, using test instances with up to 762 requests based on a real-world road network, show that in certain conditions, exploiting stochastic information about travel speeds leads to significant improvements over deterministic approaches.}

This problem is relevant in applications where the duration of each route is limited, for example when perishable goods are transported. In this work, we assume that a fixed-size fleet of vehicles is available and that it might not be possible to serve all customer requests, due to time constraints. Accordingly, the objective is first to maximize the number of served customers and then, to minimize the total distance traveled by the vehicles. An adaptive large neighborhood search, exploiting the ruin-and-recreate principle, is proposed for solving this problem. The various destruction and reconstruction operators take advantage of the hierarchical nature of the problem by working either at the customer, route or workday level. Computational results on Euclidean instances, derived from well-known benchmark instances, demonstrate the benefits of this multi-level approach.}

We propose an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) for its solution. The key novelty of the approach is an exact amortized constant-time algorithm for evaluating the feasibility of request insertions in the repair steps of the ALNS. In addition, we use two optional improvement techniques: a local-search based, intra-route improvement of routes of promising solutions using the Balas-Simonetti neighborhood, and the solution of a set-partitioning model over a subset of all routes generated during the search. With these techniques, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality. New best solutions are found for several benchmark instances.},

abstract = {Dial-a-ride services provide disabled and elderly people with a personalized mode of transportation to preserve their mobility. Typically, several users with different pickup and dropoff locations are transported on a vehicle simultaneously. The focus in dial-a-ride problems (DARPs) is mainly on minimizing routing cost. Service quality has been taken into account in the models by imposing time windows and limiting the maximum ride time of each user. We extend the classical DARP by an additional feature of service quality referred to as driver consistency. Customers of dial-a-ride services are often sensitive to changes in their daily routine. This aspect includes the person who is providing the transportation service, i.e., the driver of the vehicle. Our problem, called the driver consistent dial-a-ride problem (DC-DARP), considers driver consistency by bounding the maximum number of different drivers that transport a user over a multi-period planning horizon. We propose different formulations of the problem and examine their efficiency when applied in a Branch-and-Cut fashion. Additionally, we develop a large neighborhood search algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time. Over 1000 instances are generated with close reference to real world scenarios. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the quality of the solution approaches and to provide insights into the new problem. Results reveal that the cost of offering driver consistency varies greatly in magnitude. Depending on the instance, the cost of assigning one driver to each user can be up to 27.98\% higher compared to a low-cost solution. However, routing cost increases by not more than 5.80\% if users are transported by at least two drivers.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (H-DARP) that consists of determining a vehicle route planning for heterogeneous users’ transportation with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the problem. Efficient construction heuristics, crossover operators and local search techniques, specifically tailored to the characteristics of the H-DARP, are provided. The proposed algorithm is tested on 92 benchmarks instances and 40 newly introduced larger instances. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms for the DARP and H-DARP. When tested on the existing instances, we achieved average gaps of only 0.47\% to the best-known solutions for the DARP, and 0.05\% to the optimal solutions for the H-DARP, compared to 0.85\% and 0.10\%, respectively, obtained by the current state-of-the-art algorithms. For the 40 newly generated instances, average gaps of the hybrid GA are 0.35\% smaller compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Besides, our method provides best results for 31 of these instances and ties with the existing method on 8 other instances.}

  abstract={This paper studies an extension of the well-known one-to-one pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows. In the latter problem, requests to transport goods from pickup to delivery locations must be fulfilled by a set of vehicles with limited capacity subject to time window constraints at locations. The goods are not interchangeable; what is picked up at one particular location must be delivered to one particular other location. The extension discussed here consists in the consideration of a heterogeneous vehicle fleet comprising lorries with detachable trailers. Trailers are advantageous as they increase the overall vehicle capacity. However, some locations may be accessible only by a lorry without a trailer. Therefore, special locations are available where trailers can be parked while lorries visit accessibility-constrained locations. This induces a nontrivial tradeoff between an enlarged vehicle capacity and the necessity of scheduling detours for parking and reattaching a trailer. The contribution of the present paper is threefold: (i) It studies a practically relevant generalization of the one-to-one pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows. (ii) It develops an exact amortized constant-time procedure for testing the feasibility of an insertion of a transport task into a given route with regard to time windows and lorry and trailer capacities and embeds this test in an adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm for the heuristic solution of the problem. (iii) It provides a comprehensive set of benchmark instances on which the running time of the constant-time test is compared with a naïve one that requires linear time. The results of computational experiments show signiﬁcant speedups of one order of magnitude on average.},

abstract = {Vehicle routing problems arise in many practical situations in the context of transportation logistics. Among them, we can highlight the problem of transporting customers from origin to destination locations, which is known as the dial-a-ride problem (DARP). This problem consists of designing least-cost routes to serve pickup-and-delivery requests, while meeting capacity, time window, maximum route duration, and maximum ride time constraints. This work proposes a hybrid algorithm to solve single and multi-depot DARP variants where both the demands and vehicle fleet are heterogeneous. The method combines the iterated local search metaheuristic with an exact procedure based on a set partitioning approach. In addition, several procedures were implemented to speedup the local search phase. Extensive computational experiments were conducted on existing and newly proposed benchmark instances in order to evaluate the impact of the different components of the algorithm, and to compare its performance against the best existing method. The results obtained suggest that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing highly competitive results regarding both solution quality and CPU time, and of improving several best known solutions.}

The O2O parcels, such as flowers and cakes, are often delivered intra city with a time window constraint. It is driven by the concept of delivery-as-a-service, which targets at building consolidated infrastructure and using the same fleet of vehicles to provide standardized delivery services for different types of merchants. We formulate it as an integration of Multi-Depot Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem (MDMTVRP) and Paired Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window (PPDPTW). To solve the mixed problem of MDMTVRP and PPDPTW, we present its Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model to obtain the optimal solution for small-scale instances. To solve large-scale problems, we propose a hybrid neighborhood search strategy to effectively combine the merits of ALNS and tabu search. We also present a two-level pruning strategy that can significantly accelerate the local search procedure. We conduct extensive numeric experiments on multiple datasets, and results showed that our hybrid approach achieved near-optimal performance and established clear superiority over ALNS and tabu search.}

ABSTRACT = {The transportation of elderly and impaired people is commonly solved as a Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP). The DARP aims to design pick-up and delivery vehicle routing schedules. Its main objective is to accommodate as many users as possible with a minimum operation cost. It adds realistic precedence and transit time constraints on the pairing of vehicles and customers. This paper tackles the DARP with time windows (DARPTW) from a new and innovative angle as it combines hybridization techniques with an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic algorithm. The main objective is to improve the overall real-life performance of vehicle routing operations. Real-life data are refined and fed to a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (Hybrid-ALNS) algorithm which provides a near-optimal routing solution. The computational results on real-life instances, in the Canadian city of Vancouver and its region, and DARPTW benchmark instances show the potential improvements achieved by the proposed heuristic and its adaptability.},

Typically, users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup and a drop off location and a fleet of minibuses or taxis is used to serve these requests. The underlying optimization problem can be modeled as a dial-a-ride problem. In the dial-a-ride problem considered in this paper, total routing costs are minimized while respecting time window, maximum user ride time, maximum route duration, and vehicle capacity restrictions.

    abstract = { In December 2006, Netherlands Railways introduced a completely new timetable. Its objective was to facilitate the growth of passenger and freight transport on a highly utilized railway network and improve the robustness of the timetable, thus resulting in fewer operational train delays. Modifications to the existing timetable, which was constructed in 1970, were not an option; additional growth would require significant investments in the rail infrastructure. Constructing a railway timetable from scratch for about 5,500 daily trains was a complex problem. To support this process, we generated several timetables using sophisticated operations research techniques. Furthermore, because rolling-stock and crew costs are principal components of the costs of a passenger railway operator, we used innovative operations research tools to devise efficient schedules for these two resources. The new resource schedules and the increased number of passengers resulted in an additional annual profit of €40 million (\$60 million); the additional revenues generated approximately €10 million of this profit. We expect this profit to increase to €70 million (\$105 million) annually in the coming years. However, the benefits of the new timetable for the Dutch society as a whole are much greater: more trains are transporting more passengers on the same railway infrastructure, and these trains are arriving and departing on schedule more than they ever have in the past. In addition, the rail transport system will be able to handle future transportation demand growth and thus allow cities to remain accessible to more people. Therefore, we expect that many will switch from car transport to rail transport, thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. }

ABSTRACT = {During the global 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, the advantages of online food delivery (FD) were obvious, as it facilitated consumer access to prepared meals and enabled food providers to keep operating. However, online FD is not without its critics, with reports of consumer and restaurant boycotts. It is, therefore, time to take stock and consider the broader impacts of online FD, and what they mean for the stakeholders involved. Using the three pillars of sustainability as a lens through which to consider the impacts, this review presents the most up-to-date research in this field, revealing a raft of positive and negative impacts. From an economic standpoint, while online FD provides job and sale opportunities, it has been criticized for the high commission it charges restaurants and questionable working conditions for delivery people. From a social perspective, online FD affects the relationship between consumers and their food, as well as influencing public health outcomes and traffic systems. Environmental impacts include the significant generation of waste and its high carbon footprints. Moving forward, stakeholders must consider how best to mitigate the negative and promote the positive impacts of online FD to ensure that it is sustainable in every sense.},

All problem variants are transformed into a rich pickup and delivery model and solved using the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) framework presented in Ropke and Pisinger [An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Transportation Science, to appear]. The ALNS framework is an extension of the large neighborhood search framework by Shaw [Using constraint programming and local search methods to solve vehicle routing problems. In: CP-98, Fourth international conference on principles and practice of constraint programming, Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1520, 1998. p. 417–31] with an adaptive layer. This layer adaptively chooses among a number of insertion and removal heuristics to intensify and diversify the search. The presented approach has a number of advantages: it provides solutions of very high quality, the algorithm is robust, and to some extent self-calibrating. Moreover, the unified model allows the dispatcher to mix various variants of VRP problems for individual customers or vehicles. As we believe that the ALNS framework can be applied to a large number of tightly constrained optimization problems, a general description of the framework is given, and it is discussed how the various components can be designed in a particular setting. The paper is concluded with a computational study, in which the five different variants of the vehicle routing problem are considered on standard benchmark tests from the literature. The outcome of the tests is promising as the algorithm is able to improve 183 best known solutions out of 486 benchmark tests. The heuristic has also shown promising results for a large class of vehicle routing problems with backhauls as demonstrated in Ropke and Pisinger [A unified heuristic for a large class of vehicle routing problems with backhauls.

These vehicles have different capacities, fixed and variable operating costs, length and width in dimension, and two-dimensional loading constraints. The objective of this problem is to minimize transportation cost of designed routes, according to which vehicles are used, to satisfy the customer demand. In this study, we proposed a simulated annealing with heuristic local search (SA_HLS) to solve the problem and the search was then extended with a collection of packing heuristics to solve the loading constraints in 2L-HFVRP. To speed up the search process, a data structure was used to record the information related to loading feasibility. The effectiveness of SA_HLS was tested on benchmark instances derived from the two-dimensional loading vehicle routing problem (2L-CVRP). In addition, the performance of SA_HLS was also compared with three other 2L-CVRP models and four HFVRP methods found in the literature.},
